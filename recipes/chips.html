    <h1>Chips Recipe</h1>
    <p>Make microwave potato chips with this easy recipe. They are a tasty, easy, and economical alternative to store-bought potato chips. A mandoline makes slicing the potato into paper-thin slices a breeze.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 potato, sliced paper thin (peel optional)</li>
        <li>teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly grease a large dinner plate with cooking spray; set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a plastic bag (a produce bag works well). Add potato slices and shake to coat. Arrange potato slices in a single layer on the prepared plate.</li>
        <li>Cook in the microwave on high until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove chips to a large bowl and toss with salt. Chips will crisp as they cool. Repeat with remaining potato slices; no need to grease the plate again.</li>
    </ol>
